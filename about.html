           <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            a group of predominantly elder scrolls online players who have met through 
            in-game means over the years and have been gaming together ever since.
	        a mix of streamers and casual players
	        based out of the Gay Street Gamers building, our events are a mix of on-location gamers
            and PlayStation players from all around the EU. you can come see us in action, or watch 
            one of our squad streams on Twitch.

        <div>
            <h2>What We're Doing</h2>
            getting into an mmorpg can be a daunting experience, so we hope to educate newer players 
            through our "it's okay to be a noob" sessions
	        ESO is a massive game, even seasoned players may not always know what to do/how to do it. 
            so, we'll be hosting set showcases and reviews, dungeon and trial runs and more
	        but, ultimately, we're here to have fun - join us as we role-play as heroes and heroines, 
            murderers and assassins, famers and housing-enthusiasts and much more
