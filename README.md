Purpose

Gay Street Gamers is a site made by Elder Scrolls Online gamers for Elder Scrolls Online gamers. It serves the dual purpose of promoting the Twitch channel and other social medias of the team running the site, as well as providing a place for players to get information on the game, watch others play difficult content and ask questions to experienced players.

Design

Images

All the images used on the site are related to the Elder Scrolls Online, and not just video gaming in general. I chose specific images I felt reflected the beauty of the game, both in character design and landscaping, lighting, colors etc.
The color theme of the images matches that of the site as a whole, which is focussed around purples and blues.

Color

The main colors used on the site are purples, with some blues, against a black page background.

Purple:
#ca92e0 is used for most of the body text and the menu links
#6738b3 is used for most of the headings and the site logo

Variations on the above colors were used where the colors of the background images required it for visual accessibility

Blue:
#a8d2d2 is used in the image-text for the about us and contact us pages

Fonts

The two fonts used on the site are Major Mono (main headings & nav links) and Oxanium (body and other headings). I chose these two as they are quite similar but provide a decent contrast and are very easy to read. I experimented with some fonts which were close to what is used in ESO and other Elder Scrolls games, but found they impacted the readability of the text on the website, and thus chose to focus on imagery to give users a taste of what ESO is like, visually.
I used text transform to make the headings and links uppercase for contrast.
I also used text zoom for most of the information text as I thought this was a fun feature to experiment with and it adds an extra level of interactivity which I believe gamers will subconsciously enjoy. It also helps with focussing on text.

Features

Existing Features

Navigation Bar

The fully responsive navigation bar features a logo which links back to the homepage, as well as links to the home, about us and contact us pages. It is the same on each page and includes a background highlight on hover and active underline features so its clear to the user where they're going and where they are. There is no need to use the brower's back button to navigate the website.

Hero Images

Each page features a full-width image from the Elder Scrolls Online with image text over it providing a short description of what the page is about.
I chose to continue the theme of a large image across all three pages as I found it satisfying when switching between pages to not have a sudden change in page layout. On full screen laptops, the image leaves space at the bottom allowing the first of that page's headings to be visible, encouraging the user to scroll down to see the content. 

Home

The homepage provides background information on what the Elder Scrolls Online is and what's currently happening in the game, as well as telling the user about that week's upcoming events.

I chose to provide a link to an external page in the Chapter DLC section of the homepage as I felt it redundant to include all the information about the High Isles DLC in my own website as there are other sites which have already gone ahead and done that; and also that simply giving an overview of the Chapter's main features fit better with the overall content inclusion on my site. 

Events

The events section will be continously updated and details what is focussed on in each Twitch session. 

About Us

The about us page introduces the user to the team behind the site and why they've chosen to come together to make a collaborative place for players both new and experienced.

Contact Us

The contact us page provides a form for users to send any questions they may have to the team. The form has three checkbox options to help categorise the query.
The page features an aside, explaining to users what sort of things they can expect help with and what is dependent on the platform they game on. 

Footer

The footer is the same across all three pages and features links to the teams' Twitch, Discord, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram pages.

Validation




Future Installments

- The checkboxes on the form are not required to be checked in order for the form to be submitted, unlike the text fields, as HTML5 doesn't allow the instruction of at least one box needing to be checked amongst multiple.
Once I've learnt the relevant JavaScript, I'll add this feature to the boxes.
