                <p>With the release of Tamriel Unlimited, gameplay in ESO is mostly non-linear.
                    If you have access to the relevant DLC content, all areas are available to you immediately.
                    There's currently eleven area expansions and even more dungeons.
                    That's a lot of places to explore!

                    The High Elf's aptitude for magic to be a powerful sorcerer?
                    Or maybe become a Nord, hardened from a life in Tamriel's toughest climates and 
                    able to survive any challenge?

                    Or a Templar, with powerful healing spells ready to lend a hand to those in need?
                    Or perhaps a Necromancer, feared and shunned with an army of the Undead?

                    There are two main crises at hand: the battle for the Ruby Throne - to control the land; and the
                    battle to save Tamriel from Molag Bal's invasion, a Daedric Lord who has placed the fate of the world
                    in the balance.
                    However, each land is suffering its own conflicts, and it's down to you, the player, to decide
                    who wins and who loses.

            <h2>What is Elder Scrolls Online?</h2>
            the elder scrolls online is a mmorpg (massive multiplayer online role-playing game).
            released in 2014 by the folks over at Bethesda, it is the most recent major platform release
            in the Elder Scrolls universe
            it is continually added to year on year, currently boasting eleven area expansions and several
            harder-than-base-game group dungeons which coincide with the year's release
            
        </div>
        <div>
           <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            a group of predominantly elder scrolls online players who have met through 
            in-game means over the years and have been gaming together ever since.
	        a mix of streamers and casual players
	        based out of the Gay Street Gamers building, our events are a mix of on-location gamers
            and PlayStation players from all around the EU. you can come see us in action, or watch 
            one of our squad streams on Twitch. 
           
        </div>  
        
        <div>
            <h2>What We're Doing</h2>
            getting into an mmorpg can be a daunting experience, so we hope to educate newer players 
            through our "it's okay to be a noob" sessions
	        ESO is a massive game, even seasoned players may not always know what to do/how to do it. 
            so, we'll be hosting set showcases and reviews, dungeon and trial runs and more
	        but, ultimately, we're here to have fun - join us as we role-play as heroes and heroines, 
            murderers and assassins, famers and housing-enthusiasts and much more
