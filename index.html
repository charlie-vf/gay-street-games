                <hr>
                <p>ESO is a massive multiplayer online roleplaying game.
                    This means you can see other players in real time!
                    You can ignore them and go about your game, or group up, join player Guilds, help them defeat monsters,
                    talk, travel together and more!

                <h3>Tamriel</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>ESO is set in the fictional land of Tamriel.
                    There are two main crises at hand: the battle between the three Alliances for the Ruby Throne - the seat of the land; and the
                    battle to save Tamriel from Molag Bal's invasion, a Daedric Lord who holds the fate of the world in his hands.
                    However, each land is suffering its own conflicts, and it's down to you, the player, to decide
                    who wins and who loses.

                <h3>Races</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>You can choose from 9 playable races (or 10 if you buy the Imperial upgrade).
                    Will you utilise the Khajiit's natural talent for sneaking to become a notorious thief?
                    The High Elf's aptitude for magic to be a powerful sorcerer?
                    Or maybe become a Nord, hardened from a life in Tamriel's toughest climates and 
                    able to survive any challenge?
                    Don't worry, you can create 9 characters, so you don't even have to choose!

                <p>There are 6 classes available, ranging from healers to damage dealers to tanks.
                    Will you be a Nightblade, masters of shadows and subterfuge?
                    Or a Templar, with powerful healing spells ready to lend a hand to those in need?
                    Or perhaps a Necromancer, feared and shunned with an army of the Undead?

            <h3>Chapter DLC</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                This year's DLC (downloadable content) is <a href="https://eso-hub.com/en/dlc/high-isle" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens new window for ESO-Hub.com page with information on High Isles DLC">High Isles</a>, an expansion chapter centered around the Alliance War - the battle for the Ruby Throne mentioned above. 
                The land is Breton dominated, a class which has mostly existed in the background of ESO, so we're really excited to see them finally get some history and lore.
            </p> 
            <p>
                ESO expansions release in stages, with the first being a Dungeon DLC. So far, we have access to the Ascending Tide DLC, which features the Coral Aerie and Shipwright's Regret group dungeons. These act as precursors to the main chapter, which is always released in Q2, around June time, but are not crucial to understanding or enjoying the story of the DLC as a whole. They are difficult bonus content, four players are recommended, which yield unique rewards and help tide (pun not intended) us over until the big release.
            </p>
            <p> 
                This expansion is also introducing a card game, Tales of Tribute, and those of us who have played Gwent in The Witcher can't wait to try our hand at this strategy game.

            <p>
                The next event that has been confirmed is Zeal of Zenithar, which will take place in June.
                As Zenithar is the Elder Scrolls god of work and commerce, players will earn rewards on:
                <ul>
                    <li>The first Crafting Writ completed each day, per account</li>
                    <li>All Master Writs (randomly obtained by completing maximum level crafting writs)</li>
                    <li>All World Bosses, World Events and Group Challenges conquered whilst grouped with someone from a player Guild you're a part of.</li>
                </ul>
                The focus on completing activities with Guild members is new, so we're interested to see how this will play out.
                <br><hr>
                The Gay Street team's favourite events are the Witch's Festival, a spooky celebration which takes place around Hallowe'en, and the Jester's Festival, 
                during which you are tasked with hilarious activities for equally hilarious rewards.
