                <hr>
                <p>ESO is a massive multiplayer online roleplaying game.
                    This means you can see other players in real time!
                    You can ignore them and go about your game, or group up, help them defeat monsters,
                    talk, travel together and more!

                <h3>Tamriel</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>ESO is set in the fictional land of Tamriel.
                    There are two main crises at hand: the battle between the three Alliances for the Ruby Throne - the seat of the land; and the
                    battle to save Tamriel from Molag Bal's invasion, a Daedric Lord who holds the fate of the world in his hands.
                    However, each land is suffering its own conflicts, and it's down to you, the player, to decide
                    who wins and who loses.

                <h3>Races</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>You can choose from 9 playable races (or 10 if you buy the Imperial upgrade).
                    Will you utilise the Khajiit's natural talent for sneaking to become a notorious thief?
                    The High Elf's aptitude for magic to be a powerful sorcerer?
                    Or maybe become a Nord, hardened from a life in Tamriel's toughest climates and 
                    able to survive any challenge?
                    Don't worry, you can create 9 characters, so you don't even have to choose!

                <p>There are 6 classes available, ranging from healers to damage dealers to tanks.
                    Will you be a Nightblade, masters of shadows and subterfuge?
                    Or a Templar, with powerful healing spells ready to lend a hand to those in need?
                    Or perhaps a Necromancer, feared and shunned with an army of the Undead?

        <h3>DLC</h3>
        <p>
            This year's DLC (downloadable content) is High Isles, an expansion centered around the Alliance War - the battle for the Ruby Throne. 
            The land is Breton dominated, a class which has mostly existed in the background of ESO, so we're really excited to see them finally 
            get some history and lore.
            This expansion is also introducing a card game, Tales of Tribute, and those of us who have played Gwent in The Witcher can't wait to
            try our hand at this strategy game.

        <h3>Event</h3>
        <p>
            The Anniversary Event is currently taking place and will be runnning until the 19th April. This event marks the 8 year Anniversary
            of ESO and gives players an XP boost from all sources, as well as extra rewards for completing Daily Quests. Rewards including unique
            armour and weapon styles, customization options for player characters, mounts, pets and more.
            There are multiple events throughout the year and they all follow a similar structure, but feature their own perks, rewards and quests.
